# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Z Cater
Raymond Zhang

# Intentions:

We want to create a text file editor. It will be a terminal based text editor with editing as well as copy-pasting capabilities.

# Intended usage:

It will be called from the shell and run on the terminal. 
  
# Technical Details:

Topics we will be using: 
- Working with files
- Finding information about files
- Signals to deal with interrupts and kill commands
- Semaphores to prevent editing of files from too many users/random outside users

Project Breakdown:

- Reading file and displaying on screen (Raymond)
- Dealing with keyboard input (Z)
- Moving file around (Raymond)
- Saving and closing file (Z)

Data Structures:

- a copy paste buffer
- file buffer
- 
A description of your technical design. This should include:
       
What data structures you will be using and how.
     
What algorithms and /or data structures you will be using, and how.
    
# Intended pacing:

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project.
